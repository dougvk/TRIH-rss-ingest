# Data Storage Rules

1. **Database Initialization**  
   - Use SQLite’s built-in module (`sqlite3`).
   - On module load or first function call, ensure the `episodes` table exists.

2. **Table Schema**  
   - Store fields: `id (PRIMARY KEY)`, `title`, `description`, `link`, `published`.
   - If additional columns are needed, keep them consistent across the codebase.

3. **Connection Management**  
   - Open a connection using `sqlite3.connect(db_path)`.
   - Use context managers or ensure connections/cursors are properly closed.

4. **Data Insertion**  
   - Insert episodes in a batch where possible.
   - Handle unique constraints (if any) gracefully (e.g., ignore duplicates based on `link`).

5. **Error Handling**  
   - Log database errors and raise exceptions only if the operation can’t recover.
   - If partial inserts fail, provide a rollback or handle the state appropriately.
