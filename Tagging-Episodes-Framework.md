Episode Tagging Taxonomy and Track Suggestions

This document offers a two–layer approach to organizing the episodes. The first section provides a taxonomy of broad thematic categories (tags) that cut across series and standalone episodes. The second section proposes up to 20 “tracks” – curated guided paths that group episodes sharing a common narrative or subject matter.

1. Thematic Tagging for Episodes

You can organize your episodes by applying two layers of tags:

A. Series versus Standalone
	•	Series Episodes: Episodes that are parts of multi–episode series (e.g. “Emperors of Rome”, “The Fall of the Aztecs”, “RIHC: …” bonus segments).
	•	Standalone Episodes: One–off explorations that cover a single topic or story.

B. Broad Thematic Categories

These themes connect episodes that share similar topics, regardless of whether they belong to a series or are standalone. Some suggested themes include:
	•	Ancient & Classical Civilizations
Focus: Episodes about early civilizations and the classical world.
Examples: Dedicated series on Roman emperors (“Rubicon: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic”), explorations of Greece, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, etc.
Use if: A listener wants to follow the story of how the ancient world was built and how its myths and politics still resonate.
	•	Medieval & Renaissance Europe
Focus: The Dark Ages through the Renaissance.
Examples: Episodes on the Crusades, the Peasants’ Revolt, medieval monarchs (e.g. “Lady Jane Grey”), religious and political transformations.
Use if: You’d like to explore feudal conflict, the Reformation’s beginnings, and medieval life’s turbulence.
	•	Empire, Colonialism & Exploration
Focus: Episodes about how empires were built, expanded, and collapsed.
Examples: “The Roman Conquest of Britain”, “The Fall of the Aztecs” series, colonial-era explorations, episodes on explorers like Captain Cook.
Use if: Your audience is interested in the global spread of power, cross–cultural encounters, and colonial legacies.
	•	Modern Political History & Leadership
Focus: From the American Revolution and the rise of nation–states to modern political scandals.
Examples: Episodes on American presidents and British prime ministers, modern electoral politics, and leadership style analyses.
Use if: Listeners want a throughline from empire to modern nation–states.
	•	Military History & Battles
Focus: The art and strategy of war, pivotal battles, and military innovations.
Examples: Dedicated battle series such as “Trafalgar: …”, “Thermopylae & Salamis”, episodes on World Wars or the American Civil War.
Use if: You wish to follow adrenaline–filled narratives and tactical masterpieces.
	•	Cultural, Social & Intellectual History
Focus: How art, literature, music, fashion, and everyday life both reflect and shape society.
Examples: Episodes on the history of chocolate, British food (e.g. “England: Beef and Liberty”), pop–cultural reinterpretations (e.g. “History on Film”, “Game of Thrones”), and cultural revolutions.
Use if: Your users want to see history through the lens of everyday life and identity.
	•	Science, Technology & Economic History
Focus: Episodes on transformative inventions, economic shifts, and technological breakthroughs.
Examples: Episodes on the Industrial Revolution, the birth of the railways, the history of oil, or modern tech phenomena like Silicon Valley.
Use if: You’d like to trace innovation and its impact on society.
	•	Religious, Ideological & Philosophical History
Focus: The evolution of belief systems, spiritual movements, and ideological changes.
Examples: Tracks covering the Reformation (e.g. “Martin Luther …”), the history of the Church (including crucifixion, martyrdom, sacred texts), and episodes on mythic figures (such as the Holy Grail or Atlantis).
Use if: You want to follow the arc of faith, spirituality, and morality.
	•	Historical Mysteries, Conspiracies & Scandals
Focus: Episodes on unsolved cases, disputed events, or notorious scandals.
Examples: Assassinations (like the JFK series), episodes on secret societies, mysterious archaeological finds, and alternative interpretations of “official” history.
Use if: Listeners enjoy puzzles, alternative interpretations, or the darker side of history.
	•	Regional & National Histories
Focus: Tracks that allow users to deep–dive into the history of a specific country or region.
Examples: “America in …”, “British History” episodes, or more focused series like “Canada: Beaver Wars”, “Senegal: The Door of No Return”, “Australia Before Cook”, etc.
Use if: A visitor wants a track focused on a particular nation or region.

Additional Meta–Tags

You may also want to apply tags for recurring formats or series:
	•	RIHC Series: For all bonus episodes marked “RIHC: …”
	•	Archive Editions: For episodes marked “ARCHIVE: …”
	•	Multi–Part Series: Episodes with “Part 1”, “Ep 1”, etc.

How to Use These Tags & Tracks
	•	Tagging: Apply the thematic categories (and meta–tags) to each episode. An episode may have multiple tags (e.g., a Roman military episode might get tagged “Ancient & Classical Civilizations,” “Military & Battles,” and “Roman Track”).
	•	Tracks on the Website: Use the track list as a navigation tool. For example, a “Roman Track” page might pull together all episodes tagged as Roman-related, regardless of whether they come from a series or are standalone.
	•	Cross–Tagging: Allow episodes to appear in more than one track. This way, a listener interested in military history might also see episodes that are part of the “Roman Track” if they share that focus.
