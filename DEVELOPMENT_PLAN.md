# RSS Feed Processor Development Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration ✓
- Create directory structure
- Setup virtual environment
- Create initial requirements.txt with core dependencies
- Implement config.py for environment variable handling
- Create .env template
- Add data directory management
- Add configuration validation

## Phase 2: Feed Ingestion ✓
- Implement feed_ingest.py:
  - HTTP request functionality with timeouts
  - Support for URL-based authentication
  - XML parsing with lxml
  - iTunes namespace support
  - Error handling for network/parsing issues
- Create Episode model with dataclass
- Add unit tests with requests-mock
- Verify with real feed (729 episodes)

## Phase 3: Storage Layer ✓
- Implement storage.py:
  - SQLite connection management
  - Schema creation with indexes
  - CRUD operations for episodes
  - Transaction handling
  - Datetime handling with timezone support
  - Duplicate handling via GUID
- Add database migration capability
- Performance optimization (~0.01s for 729 episodes)

## Phase 4: Integration ✓
- Implement main.py orchestration
- Connect feed ingestion to storage
- Add proper error handling
- Implement logging with timing metrics
- Performance testing:
  - Feed fetch: ~1.0s
  - XML parse: ~0.03s
  - DB storage: ~0.01s
  - Total: ~1.1s

## Phase 5: Testing & Hardening ✓
- Integration tests
- Mock feed creation (729 episodes)
- Error scenario testing
- Edge case handling
- Performance verification
- Test independence (no network dependency)

## Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment ✓
- Complete README with:
  - Installation steps
  - Configuration guide
  - Usage examples
  - Performance metrics
  - Deployment tips
- Add comprehensive docstrings
- Document error scenarios
- Add deployment instructions
- Include maintenance guidelines

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Dataclass for episode representation
- Context managers for resource handling
- Comprehensive logging

### Database
- SQLite for simplicity and performance
- Efficient indexing strategy
- Transaction-based operations
- Automatic timestamp tracking

### Testing
- pytest for test framework
- Mock feed for integration tests
- Performance measurements
- Error scenario coverage

### Performance Optimizations
- Batch database operations
- Efficient XML parsing
- Connection pooling
- Index usage for queries

## Detours and Improvements
1. **Feed Authentication:**
   - Switched from header-based to URL-based auth
   - Simplified configuration needs

2. **Link Field:**
   - Made optional with default empty string
   - Adapted to feed structure

3. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Added mock feed for integration tests
   - Removed dependency on live feed
   - Improved test speed (4.33s → 0.14s)

4. **Performance Tracking:**
   - Added timing measurements
   - Documented performance metrics
   - Verified with real feed

## Benefits of This Approach
- Independent component testing
- No external dependencies in tests
- Fast and reliable test suite
- Clear performance metrics
- Easy deployment
- Maintainable codebase
