# Podcast Feed Processor - Phase 1 PRD

## Overview

The Podcast Feed Processor is a lean application designed to ingest a private podcast RSS feed, parse the episode details, and store the data for future search and analysis. Phase 1 focuses on building a solid foundation by fetching the feed, extracting key information (title, description, link, published date, etc.), and storing it in a local SQLite database.

## Objectives

- **Data Ingestion:** Securely fetch a private RSS feed using HTTP requests with appropriate authentication.
- **Data Parsing:** Extract episode metadata (title, description, link, published date) using robust XML parsing.
- **Data Storage:** Persist the parsed data in a SQLite database for efficient retrieval and later processing.
- **Modular Architecture:** Develop a clean and modular codebase that can be extended for additional features in later phases.

## User Stories

- **As a user,** I want to run a script that automatically downloads and parses my private podcast RSS feed so that I have a local copy of all episode details.
- **As a user,** I need the tool to securely handle authentication for the private RSS feed.
- **As a user,** I want the parsed episode data to be stored in a structured format (SQLite database) for future search and categorization.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **RSS Feed Ingestion:**
   - Fetch the private RSS feed using an HTTP GET request.
   - Handle authentication via HTTP headers (e.g., Bearer token).
2. **RSS Parsing:**
   - Parse the XML feed using lxml for robust XML handling.
   - Extract at least the following fields from each episode:
     - Title
     - Description
     - Link
     - Published date
3. **Data Storage:**
   - Initialize and connect to a SQLite database.
   - Create an `episodes` table if it does not exist.
   - Insert the parsed episode data into the database.
4. **Configuration:**
   - Use environment variables (with a `.env` file) for configurable parameters such as the RSS feed URL and authentication token.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Modularity:** Ensure the codebase is modular to facilitate later enhancements (e.g., adding NLP features or a web interface).
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging for network issues, parsing errors, and database failures.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear inline documentation and update the README with setup and usage instructions.
- **Security:** Securely manage sensitive data such as authentication tokens by using environment variables.

## Architecture & Design

### Folder Structure

Below is the recommended folder structure for the project:
podcast_feed_processor/
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── .env
├── data/
│   └── episodes.db
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── config.py
│   ├── feed_ingest.py
│   ├── storage.py
│   └── main.py
└── tests/

### Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Modules:**
  - `requests` for HTTP requests.
  - `lxml` for XML parsing.
  - `python-dotenv` for loading environment variables.
  - Built-in `sqlite3` for database operations.
  - Python's `logging` for error and event logging.

### Key Modules and Their Roles

1. **src/config.py**
   - Loads configuration settings (e.g., RSS_FEED_URL) from environment variables.
2. **src/feed_ingest.py**
   - Contains functions to fetch the RSS feed and parse its content using `lxml`.
   - Provides functions like `fetch_rss_feed()` and `parse_rss_feed(feed_content)`.
3. **src/storage.py**
   - Manages SQLite database connection, table creation, and data insertion.
   - Functions include `init_db()` to create the episodes table and `store_episodes(episodes)` to insert records.
4. **src/main.py**
   - Serves as the orchestrator: initializes the database, calls the feed ingestion functions, and stores parsed data.

## Workflow

1. **Database Initialization:**
   - On script startup, connect to the SQLite database and ensure the `episodes` table exists.
2. **Feed Fetching:**
   - Use the `requests` library to GET the RSS feed URL with the necessary authentication header.
   - Handle any network or authentication errors gracefully.
3. **Feed Parsing:**
   - Parse the downloaded XML feed with `lxml`.
   - Extract required fields from each entry in the feed.
4. **Data Storage:**
   - Insert each parsed episode into the SQLite database.
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging during database operations.

## Deliverables

- **Source Code:**  
  A fully functional Python codebase following the specified folder structure.
- **Documentation:**  
  A README with setup instructions, environment configuration details, and usage examples.
- **Database File:**  
  A SQLite database file (e.g., `data/episodes.db`) containing the parsed episodes.
- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests for the key functions in `feed_ingest.py` and `storage.py`.

## Future Considerations

- **Logging:**  
  Integrate Python's `logging` module for enhanced error reporting and debugging.
- **Testing:**  
  Write unit tests to cover each module's functionality.
- **Extensibility:**  
  Plan for future phases (e.g., search functionality, NLP enrichment, web interface, and ChatGPT integration).
- **Security Enhancements:**  
  Ensure the `.env` file is excluded from version control and consider secure vault solutions if needed.

## Instructions for the AI Coding Companion

1. **Initialize the Project:**
   - Create the folder structure as defined.
   - Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. **Implement Configurations:**
   - Write `src/config.py` to load environment variables.
3. **Develop the Ingestion Module:**
   - Implement `fetch_rss_feed()` in `src/feed_ingest.py` to fetch the RSS feed.
   - Implement `parse_rss_feed(feed_content)` to extract episode metadata.
4. **Implement the Storage Module:**
   - Develop `init_db()` and `store_episodes(episodes)` in `src/storage.py` to handle SQLite database operations.
5. **Integrate with Main Script:**
   - Write `src/main.py` to tie together fetching, parsing, and storing functions.
6. **Documentation and Testing:**
   - Update README.md with usage instructions.
   - Develop unit tests under the `tests/` directory.
